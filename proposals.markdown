The 6th HOT Summit has gone virtual! We will be holding a one-day event across several time zones on Friday, December 4th in conjunction with the <a href="https://understandrisk.org/">Understanding Risk</a> conference.

We will be celebrating our 10th anniversary of using OpenStreetMap to help our partners save and improve lives. This year’s Summit will focus on the theme of HOT’s past, present, and future. The success of the past ten years has only been possible through the collaboration of this dedicated community around the world. In that spirit, we’re planning for a Summit event that is both collaborative and engaging. We want to hear about the challenges, successes, failures, and new ideas in formats that allow everyone to contribute to the conversation in this new virtual format. To do so, we’re adding new session formats that we have enjoyed in other conferences, as well as keeping a few classics.

We welcome everyone to submit ideas during our Call for Sessions **now through 25 September 2020**. Before diving into the application, read through the session format descriptions below. Many of the options will require bringing together several individuals from the community. So, if you propose an idea for a topic or session that you would like to be a part of, we can help you find the other individuals to complete the session.

**Failfest:** Your chance to present the usually less discussed failures: potentials and pitfalls when limitations are pushed and lessons learned in leadership, innovation, and project management, as well as risk-taking. **(5-15 minutes)**

**Ignite/lightning talk:** Quick presentations about your inspiring topic, project or tool, the related challenges addressed, expected impact, and future steps. We’re really excited to hear talks that not only look at current projects and tools, but talks that look at past impacts as well as visions for the future. **(5 minutes)**

**Debate:** As a collaborative community, we have a lot of ideas and opinions. Debates are a great opportunity for hashing out these ideas IRL. After the success of last year’s Summit debate on Mapathons, we welcome ideas for other debates. Propose an idea for a debate topic that you think will spark the community into discussion and we’ll help you find a panel of debaters. **(45 minutes)**

**Dialogue:** An interactive presentation with discussion questions for the audience **(15-20 min)**

We hope you’re just as excited as we are for this year’s session formats. Once you have an idea, **fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdCKnNVcKjDA8H6LtwegBbXuLF9lgjgt3ZgT7mTRoOj73hGVg/viewform">Call for Sessions form</a>.** In order to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to participate, not just the seasoned conference speakers, the Summit Working Group is ready to work with you to polish and structure your session. We will also work with you to assist with the technical aspects of this virtual Summit.

If you’re unsure about presenting or hosting a session but have a topic or discussion you would love to see, submit your idea in the Call for Sessions form! With your idea, we might be able to find the right people to host the session.

We look forward to hearing your ideas for a collaborative and exciting HOT Summit 2020 and we look forward to seeing each of you (virtually) on December 4th!
