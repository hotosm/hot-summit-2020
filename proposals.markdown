We’re excited to announce that for the 6th HOT Summit in beautiful Cape Town, South Africa, we will be celebrating our 10th anniversary of using OpenStreetMap to help our partners save and improve lives. This year’s Summit will focus on the theme of HOT’s past, present, and future.
  
The success of the past ten years has only been possible through the collaboration of this dedicated community around the world. In that spirit, we’re planning for a Summit event that is even more collaborative and engaging than we’ve done before. We want to hear about the challenges, successes, failures, and new ideas in formats that allow everyone in attendance to contribute to the conversation. To do so, we’re adding new session formats that we have enjoyed in other conferences, as well as keeping a few classics.

We welcome everyone to submit ideas during our Call for Sessions **now through 25 March 2020**. Before diving into the application, read through the session format descriptions below. Many of the options will require bringing together several individuals from the community. So, if you propose an idea for a topic or session that you would like to be a part of, we can help you find the other individuals to complete the session.

* **Dinner Table:** Have you ever watched a panel and itched to join the conversation? This session is a spin on the traditional panel that gives the audience the opportunity to join the discussion. Two or three invited guests will start the conversation with open seats for audience members to fill in for the discussion. If you have an idea for a conversation that would work great in this format or would like to be an invited guest and are prepared to participate, let us know in the Call for Sessions form. **(45 minutes)**

* **Failfest:** Your chance to present the usually less discussed failures: potentials and pitfalls when limitations are pushed and lessons learned in leadership, innovation, and project management, as well as risk-taking. **(10-15 minutes)**

* **Training, Workshop, Activity, or Demo:** Do you have a skillset or new tool that the community can benefit from? Use this opportunity to provide an in-depth activity for participants. We just ask that you make it as engaging and hands-on as possible! **(45 or 90 minutes)**

* **Ignite/lightning talk:** Quick presentations about your inspiring topic, project or tool, the related challenges addressed, expected impact, and future steps. We’re really excited to hear talks that not only look at current projects and tools, but talks that look at past impacts as well as visions for the future. **(5 minutes)**

* **Debate:** As a collaborative community, we have a lot of ideas and opinions. Debates are a great opportunity for hashing out these ideas IRL. After the success of last year’s Summit debate on Mapathons, we welcome ideas for other debates. Propose an idea for a debate topic that you think will spark the community into discussion and we’ll help you find a panel of debaters. **(45 minutes)**

* **World Cafe:** Your chance to share your ideas and discuss a topic in a structured conversational process. Led by you or your consortium, groups of people discuss a topic at several tables, with participants switching tables periodically and getting introduced to the topic from different perspectives. Have a theme or topic that would work in this format? Propose an idea to discuss and we can help structure the session with you. **(1 hour)**

We hope you’re just as excited as we are for this year’s session formats. Once you have an idea, **fill out the [Call for Sessions form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdCKnNVcKjDA8H6LtwegBbXuLF9lgjgt3ZgT7mTRoOj73hGVg/viewform)**. In order to make sure that everyone has an opportunity to participate, not just the seasoned conference speakers, the Summit Working Group is ready to work with you to polish and structure your session.

If you’re unsure about presenting or hosting a session but have a topic or discussion you would love to see, submit your idea in the Call for Sessions form! With your idea, we might be able to find the right people to host the session.

We look forward to hearing your ideas for a collaborative and exciting HOT Summit 2020 and will see you in Cape Town, South Africa 1-2 July 2020! Early bird registration begins next week!

**On Coronavirus (COVID-19):** What makes the Summit special is that it is a truly global event; bringing together people from all over the world to share meals, experiences, and conversations. Cognizant of the current environment, but recognizing that we are still four months away from the event, we’ll be continuing to monitor the situation in the coming months. For now - please continue proposing your ideas and keep an eye on HOT communications for updates!
