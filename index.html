        <h3>Summit Update</h3>
        <p>Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the HOT Summit 2020 live event originally due to take place on 1-2 July in Cape Town, South Africa will be postponed. Although we hope that things will be back to normal by July, no one knows when regular travel and large gatherings will resume.</p>
        <p></br></p>
        <p>The HOT Summit was planned to coincide with the State of the Map live event, however, the SOTM organizers have decided to hold a virtual event on 3-5 July instead of a live event.</p>
    <p></br></p>
        <p>While a virtual meeting has its potential benefits, at HOT we feel the Summit represents a unique opportunity to meet, share experiences, learn from each other, collaborate and energize our staff, community, volunteers, partners and sponsors from around the world. Therefore, we will reschedule our live event.</p>
        <p></br></p>
        <p>In the meantime, we are taking the following measures:</br> 
We will follow up for Community input and a new date and location shortly</br>  
Ticket sales for the HOT Summit are suspended until we have a new date/venue</br>   
Program submissions are temporarily suspended and we will get in touch with those who have already submitted.</p>
  <p></br></p>
        <p>We are looking forward to sharing information about the new dates and location when the global health crisis stabilizes. If you have any questions, please contact us: summit@hototsm.org.</p>
