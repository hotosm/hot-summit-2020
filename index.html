        <h3>HOT Virtual Summit</h3>
        <p>The sixth annual HOT Summit has gone virtual! We will be holding a one-day event across several time zones on Friday, December 4th in conjunction with the <a href="https://understandrisk.org/">Understanding Risk conference</a>. </p> <br />

        <p>This year's theme is "10 Years of HOT: The Past, Present and Future of Humanitarian Mapping," so we're looking for new and engaging online presentations, dialogues, and lightning talks. </p> <br />

      <p>The HOT Summit was planned to coincide with the State of the Map live event, however, the SOTM organizers have decided to hold a virtual event on 3-5 July instead of a live event.</p>
      <p>While a virtual meeting has its potential benefits, at HOT we feel the Summit represents a unique opportunity to meet, share experiences, learn from each other, collaborate and energize our staff, community, volunteers, partners and sponsors from around the world. Therefore, we will reschedule our live event.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, we are taking the following measures:</br> 
        <ul>
        <li>We will follow up for Community input and a new date and location shortly.</li>
        <li>Ticket sales for the HOT Summit are suspended until we have a new date/venue.</li> 
        <li>Program submissions are temporarily suspended and we will get in touch with those who have already submitted.</li>
      </ul>
